# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the TrustCore and TrustEdge projects!

To protect the legal interests of DigiCert and our users, contributors must agree to the following terms before we can accept any code contributions.

## Terms

By submitting a pull request or contribution to this project, you agree that:

1. **You are the author of the contribution**, or you have the necessary rights and permissions to make the contribution on behalf of yourself or your organization.

2. **You grant DigiCert, Inc. and its affiliates** a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, sublicense, and distribute your contribution:
   - As part of the open-source project under the AGPL v3 license, and
   - As part of DigiCert’s proprietary and commercial offerings under separate commercial license terms.

3. **You agree** that your contribution may be dual-licensed by DigiCert under both:
   - The GNU Affero General Public License v3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html), and
   - DigiCert’s commercial licensing terms (e.g., https://www.digicert.com/master-services-agreement/, as updated from time to time).

4. If you are contributing on behalf of a company, you represent that you are authorized to submit the contribution and bind the company to these terms. 

5. You acknowledge that this agreement **applies to all contributions**, past and future, submitted to this project unless you notify us otherwise in writing. 

## Why This Matters

This agreement ensures:
- We maintain clean intellectual property rights over the project.
- We can continue to dual-license the project to support both open-source and commercial users. 
- You (the contributor) are clearly acknowledged and protected under open source norms. 

We may use a tool to enforce acceptance of this agreement when pull requests are submitted.
